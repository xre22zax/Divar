# Divar Analysis

## 1. Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Divar dataset, which contains various data points related to user activities on the Divar platform. The analysis focuses on understanding user behavior, identifying trends, and deriving insights that could help enhance user experience and business strategies.

## 2. Libraries Used
The following libraries were utilized in this project:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization based on Matplotlib.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing.
- **Statsmodels**: For estimating and testing statistical models.

## 3. Methods Employed
The project employs several methods and techniques for data analysis:
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, data type conversion, and data transformation.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and summarizing the main characteristics of the dataset.
- **Cohort Analysis**: Identifying patterns in user behavior over time.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Performing hypothesis testing and correlation analysis to uncover relationships within the data.
- **Machine Learning**: Using classification and regression models to predict outcomes and uncover insights.

## 4. Graphs
Various graphs and visualizations are generated throughout the analysis, including:
- **Histograms**: To show the distribution of data points.
- **Boxplots**: To display the distribution and outliers in the dataset.
- **Line Charts**: To track changes over periods of time.
- **Scatter Plots**: To examine relationships between different variables.
- **Heatmaps**: To visualize correlation matrices and highlight strong relationships.

## 5. Key Findings
- **User Acquisition Surge in 2017**: A significant increase in user acquisition was observed during Q2 2017, particularly in May and June. This spike was driven by the introduction of new services, such as ETC and ChargeMTN, which quickly became popular among users.
- **Service Usage Patterns**: ETC, ChargeMTN, and BillWater were identified as the top services during this period, indicating high user engagement with these features.
- **Retention and Engagement**: Cohort analysis revealed that users who joined in Q2 2017 were more likely to continue using the platform due to the introduction of new and relevant services.
